# webRTC-data.io
This is a branch of the client/server code on https://github.com/webRTC/webRTC.io to support data-only connections. 
Note that a fair amount of audio/video functionality was removed as it is no longer necessary in this data only case. Also, webRTC.io worked by waiting for the media streams to come online(user agreement) before connecting. This code connects immediately.

This has only been tested in Chrome Canary, Chrome & Firefox nightly.

Please note that this only supports unreliable connections at this time (in Chrome), so it is your responsibility to build in reliability within your application if it is required.
Firefox nightly supports reliable connections.

Note that there is a minor addition to what is done in webRTC.io. You must check rtc.connection_ok_to_send[id] to check the current status of the webRTC connection.

Another note - please see https://github.com/erbbysam/webRTC-data.io/commit/49366c03e51aaf2af3e36da8a9dd5bf4c701d041#diff-c30413d646b060b0092f9033ace2417dL378
This file is currently only setup to support reliable connections, backing out that one line change will bring back support for unreliable connections if you need that support

### Demo
Will be posted eventually. For the meantime, checkout https://github.com/erbbysam/webRTCCopy/

### Usage
Similar to webrtc.io, only including a username
```javascript
rtc.connect("ws:yourserveraddress:8000", room, username);
```

### Server
Using node.js, create a server simply using:
```javascript
var app = require('express')();
var server = require('http').createServer(app);
var webRTC = require('webrtc.io').listen(server);

server.listen(8000);
```

For an example of this fully setup see https://github.com/erbbysam/webRTCCopy/tree/master/server
